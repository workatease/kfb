    # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
    # example:
    fonts:
        - family: Nunito
          fonts:
              - asset: assets/fonts/Nunito-SemiBold.ttf

    #         style: italic
    #   - family: Trajan Pro
    #     fonts:
    #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
    #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
